# FETT---SFUmon
Inspired by Pokemon, SFUmon is a 2D pixel based exploration game. Using a joystick and buttons, players can move their character and watch it be displayed on an LCD screen through the BeagleBoard. The game is centered around exploring a mini SFU campus and catching creatures called SFUmon’s along the way.
